      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>
        Jonas is a lively high school student that loves Greek mythology. He knows all about the pantheon of Gods, their powers and crazy humanistic stories. He recently finished reading the 12 Labors of Hercules and got intrigued in how that
        influenced the thoughts of philosophers like Socrates that were being introduced to him by his History professor.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Learn about philosophers of ancient times</li>
                <li>See how we transitioned from myths to modern ways of explaining the world</li>
                        <li>Sharing what he learned with friends</li>
                                <li>Playing games</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frustrations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Thinks that the philosophic texts he tried to read are too difficult</li>
            <li>Finding fun ways to learn more about it</li>
                    <li>Struggles to find friends to talk about mythology</li>

</ul>

      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>
      Claire started to get interested in philosophy with a test to see which thinker would fit her personality the best. She got Aristotle, and that intrigued her because she knows not much more than he was an ancient Greek philosopher, that talked about everything. Including about Love, the theme of a recent paper for her undergrad course in Creative Writing.
  </p>

      <h2>Motivations</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Understand philosophy's main timeline
</li>
                <li>See how the idea of love transitioned from time to time
              </li>
                        <li>Get entry steps to understand philosophy</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Frustrations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Hard to find a specific theme in Aristotle's work</li>
            <li>Hard to see a correlation between different philosophers</li>
                    <li>The pages dedicated to the theme 'love' are mixed with pseudo-science</li>

</ul>
